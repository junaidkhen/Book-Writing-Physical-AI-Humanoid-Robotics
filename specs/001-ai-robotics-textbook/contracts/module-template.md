### Mathematical Foundation

[If applicable, include mathematical formulas using LaTeX syntax]

The Kalman filter update equation is:

$$
\hat{x}_{k|k} = \hat{x}_{k|k-1} + K_k(z_k - H\hat{x}_{k|k-1})
$$

Where:
- $\hat{x}_{k|k}$ is the updated state estimate
- $K_k$ is the Kalman gain
- $z_k$ is the measurement at time $k$

### Algorithm Description
